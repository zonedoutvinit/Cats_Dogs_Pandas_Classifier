This is a CNN(Convolutional neural network) to Identify image of a animal into Cat/Dog/Panda


This project uses PyTorch, Streamlit & cv2 from OpenCV
PyTorch: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
Streamlit: pip install streamlit
OpenCV: pip install opencv-python


the bestsofar.model provides the best results when it comes to identification.
the hightraindata.model was developed using most amount of data but same model structure it less accurate when comapred with previous model.
